My first source which was written by Niels Ebdrup is an article that talks about the origins of the fictional genre. The article states that the first fictional books appeared in the 12th century and the people were very surprised because back in the Middle Ages books were taken very seriously and was believed that whatever was written in a book is to be the truth. The reason for this was because the only book that most people knew was the bible. This article is relevant to my topic because it talks about the origins of the fictional genre and how people viewed books back to the Middle Ages. In my project, I can tell how fiction first started and how people reacted to this new type of book. 

My second source is an article written by Abby L. Vandiver which states how writing literature has changed over time. The article goes on to explain how technology had a big role in the change in writing and all of us were affected by this change. For example, how we write and prepare to write looks different from how it was done 20 years ago. I picked this article because as stated earlier it shows the change in writing over the years and since it generalizes writing as a whole it can refer back to the fictional genre. I can incorporate this into my project by telling how writing has changed. 

My third source is an article written by the organization BUUKS and it talks about how has fiction writing changed over the past decade. It says how writers of the fictional genre are incorporating more of different cultures into their books and how different themes are now being incorporated into the genre. I can incorporate this information into my project by showing how the themes of different books are changing and becoming broader as time passes. 

My fourth source is written by Simon Gikandi and is a book talking about a novel in Africa and the Caribbean since 1950. This book not only tells how writing was in Africa and the Caribbean but also goes more into detail about how different genres of books flourished and were seen to the people of Africa and the Caribbean. This is relevant to my project topic because it talks about literature in the Caribbean and I can add this information to my project to speak about literature in the Caribbean from 1950.

My fifth source is an article by Kamau E Brathwaite which speaks about Caribbean Literature. It says about Caribbean writing during past times and even talks about the authors. In addition, it even talks about different Caribbean authors and the books that they wrote. This kind of information could be implemented into my project by talking about some of the books that are of the fictional genre and even show developed that book.
