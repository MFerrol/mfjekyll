My name is Mckel Ferrol, I live in Wall House, I am 17 years old and I attend the Dominica State College. I am currently enrolled as a double major and these include Computer Science and Information Technology. I chose these subject areas as my major because I would like to be able to work as a programmer in the future. I am aware that there are many different types of programming jobs in the world today, and all of them look very interesting and fun to form a career out of, but I have not yet chosen which path I would want to stick to for my future career. Hence when the time comes for me to choose a specific career I already had my options open. In my free time I like to draw, play games, play sports (mainly volleyball) and make music.
