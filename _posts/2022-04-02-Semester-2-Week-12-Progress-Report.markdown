title:  "Semester 2 Week 12: Progress Report"
---

During this week I went over two of the research material Miss Esprit gave me. It didnâ€™t talk solely about the fictional genre but, about how there was no form of preservation for all the talented Caribbean literary arts, like playwriting and drama, in past. As a result, many works were lost due to the passing of time. So, this was why publication was quite important. It served as a way in preserving the works of many talented artists. However, there was not a single press that was devoted to solely Caribbean literature. The second article, which was given to me, talked about the different books written by Caribbean authors, their lives, and how their works affected the literary world. I have not read through all of the article yet but what I have read so far is very interesting. I never knew that all of this happened and the amount of struggle Caribbean authors had to go through to get their works published and known to the people. This has been very eye-opening indeed and I am very interested in learning more about Caribbean literature. In terms of work on the different tools for my project I have not made much progress. This is mainly because I want to finish as much research as I can about my project first. I feel like this will be a better course of action for me seeing how the researching aspect of any work I do is the most difficult for me.
