title: "Semester 2 Week 5: Progress Report"
---

This week I was finally done with my section of the spreadsheet and was pretty proud of myself for powering through and finishing finding all the Wikipedia sites for the authors and books. Sadly, some spaces were left blank seeing how I was unable to find any Wikipedia page for some of the authors and their books. Also, during this week Miss Esprit made three different teams and assigned specific people to the different teams for them to specialize in and master. The three teams are the Tech Team, which I am a part of, the Gio Team, and the Research Team. As the names suggest the Tech Team deals with the tech-related programs/tools we learned during the internship, the Gio Team deals with mapping and geographic programs/tools and the Research Team deals with cleaning and data integrity of the spreadsheet and different parts of the project later down. When I was ready to be assigned a new section in the spreadsheet Miss Esprit told us that Ms. Ellen and her will be finishing up the spreadsheet themselves and we will be given an assignment. She told us she will want the people of the different teams to focus on specializing in their respective fields and also focus on developing our projects. I was excited to get started in trying to learn and eventually master all the different IT base tools that we learned during the internship. On another note, for my project, I have chosen to explore the change and possibly the movement of the fictional genre. I was coming up with this topic because of all the different books I saw on the fictional genre in the spreadsheet. Also, fiction has always been very interesting to me, so seeing how there were so many books which were of the fictional genre created by Caribbean authors I thought that this was going to be a very interesting topic to investigate and explore.
