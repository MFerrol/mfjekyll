title: "Semester 2 Week 6: Intern Review"
---

This week we learned about a tool which is called Voyant. Voyant is a tool used to analyze and read digital texts. This tool is quite interesting, however, it doesn’t pique my interest much as to where I will want to use it in my project. At least not now, so my opinion could change with time, we will just have to see. But, none the less it is still quite interesting how Voyant can make so many different analyses on a book. For example, it can display what are the most used words in a book, show the frequency of different words’ occurrences on a line graph, etc. In addition to learning a new tool this week, Miss Esprit told the Tech Team about a meeting we will be having next week to discuss what the Tech Team has to do. I was excited to get started in learning more about the different tech base tools and experimenting with them. In preparation for the meeting next week Miss Esprit told the members to learn more about Jekyll and how it works because we were going to be using an addon of some sort called Liquid. I did some research on Liquid and I found out that it was a programming language template created by Shopify and is written in Ruby. I also read that Liquid is used by Shopify, Jekyll, Lucid, Zendesk, and much more. Seeing how I am currently studying java I’m hoping that Liquid would not be too much of a challenge for me to learn.
